# Learn SDL

This is my attempt to learn that thing called SDL. I'll be primarily using [this tutorial](http://stephenmeier.net/2014/08/10/sdl-2-0-tutorial-00-the-basic-sturcture/) and, of course, the [SDL API docs](https://wiki.libsdl.org/APIByCategory).

If you are trying to compile this for some reason, move makefile into the step you want to compile, then run make. (NOTE: My makefile is configured for using clang on FreeBSD so you may wish to edit it first.)
